 # Math Adventures - Adaptive Learning Prototype

This is a Python-based web application that serves as a prototype for an adaptive math learning tool. The app presents users with math puzzles and automatically adjusts the difficulty in real-time based on their performance (correctness and response time).

[cite_start]This project was built to satisfy the "Adaptive Learning Assignment" [cite: 1] [cite_start]by demonstrating a functional, rule-based adaptive engine[cite: 5].
